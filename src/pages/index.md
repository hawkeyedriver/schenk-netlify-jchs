    Johns Creek Computer Science Students learn comprehensive skills required in
    today's rapidly-advancing technology marketplace.  Our ground-up learning
    not just theory, it harnesses critical employability skills needed to be
    successful.  We focus on a hands-on project-based pedagogy that motivates
    students to succeed either in their post-secondary education or as direct
    entrants into the marketplace.

  Eligible students can now complete TWO(!) pathways with the successful
  completion of four years in this program.  Careful planning and hard work can
  result in a significant programming achievements.  Be aware of the pathway
  requirements and pre-requisites so that you have the most opportunity to
  complete the program.

        Introduction to Digital Technology (IDT) is where students begin.  This
        is where  commitment matters the most - because this course is not your
        average IDT.  At Johns Creek we are preparing students for the Harvard
        CS50 AP curriculum should they advance to AP Computer Science
        Principles.  This first course provides critical foundations for
        everything that follows in the program.  It is competitive because
        advancing seats are assigned based on performance and dedication.

        Successful IDT students progress to Harvard's CS50 AP.  This course is a
        highly regarded and world-wide implemented curriculum that is a
        pre-approved drop-in for AP Computer Science Principles.  Since its
        inception, CS50 AP students at Johns Creek have typically dominated the
        AP exam at the end of the year, and covered far more ground that the
        baseline college board curriculum.  Completing this course successfully
        prepares our students for APCS-A, the traditional end-of-pathway
        course.

        APCS-A is all about object-oriented programming.  While the college
        board recently gutted some important aspects of the curriculum, and the
        AP test remains more of a mathematics exam, we focus on the theoretical
        computer science and programming aspects of the curriculum, because that
        is what colleges are seeking in their undergrads.  We will go
        significantly beyond the AP curriculum, to include graphical user
        interface work as well as database connectivity, including the MVC
        development paradigm.  We do not skip over abstract classes and
        interfaces, we embrace them.  Students prepare for the exam in the
        Spring, and create master projects capping their pathway journey.

        Just when it couldn't get any better, we made it better.  Johns Creek is
        now offering a fourth-year course called Embedded Programming.  Senior
        pathway completers can now earn a 2nd pathway completion because this
        pathway has the same prerequisites as APCS-A.  This course is a
        project-based dive into embedded systems programming and robotics.  We
        blur the lines between computer science and engineering, and have fun
        doing so!

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
